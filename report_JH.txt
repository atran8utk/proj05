                            Time Complexity Report:

The time complexity of worddice.cpp is O(V+E^2), with V being the number 
of vertices (or nodes) and E being the number of edges. Because the main 
source of time complexity is the traversal of the graphs - which were 
created every time a new word was being analyzed and then deleted after 
the analysis was complete - the complexity is at least O(V+E). However, 
because the program transverses through the graph of nodes with an 
Edmond's Karp implementation of BFS, which alone is O(E^2), the complexity 
is then O(V+E^2).
